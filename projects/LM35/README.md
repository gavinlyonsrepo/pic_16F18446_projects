to an LCD display HD44780 via the I2C bus and a PCF8574 Interface "backpack" board
using a PIC16F18446.

Features
----------------------

This project displays  LM35 data sensor data on LCD. The values are read on a interrupt generated by overflow of timer0 every 3.26 second.

1. RC1 = LM35 Data in 

**LM35**

The LM35 outputs a signal on pin Vout, The LM35 signal is read via an analog input(RC1) 10mV per degree.  The ADC  has 0.0012207 per division. (12-bit)

LM35 calculation:

1.    Vout=0.01/°C
2.    °C=Vout/0.01
3.    °C=(Vout *  100) where  Vout = ADC_value * (VCC/ADC resolution)
4.    °C = (ADC_value * (0.0012207)) * 100
5.    °C * 100 =(ADC_value * (0.0012207)) * 10000 
6.    °C  * 100 = 488 (Solved for an ADC value of 40) 4.88°C
7.    The RHS can then be parsed by code and displayed.

**HD44780-based character LCD**

The HD44780  LCD is controlled via the 2-pin I2C bus.

In this example code, a 4-pin PCF8574 Interface "backpack" board is attached to LCD. It is controlled via the two pin I2C bus. 

1. RB4 = SDA
2. RB6 = SCLK 

The LCD code are in a separate library files. The Library supports both 16x02 and 20x04 LCD's.
The Data is sent in 4-bit mode. The upper nibble holds the data and lower nibble of byte manipulates the control bits of LCD.
